**Task ID:** T002
**Task Name:** UI/UX Design and Component Planning
**Status:** Not Started
**Assigned To:** AI & User
**Date Created:** 2025-05-04
**Date Updated:** 2025-05-04

## Description
Design the visual identity, component structure, and UI/UX implementation for the Excelsior landing page, ensuring a modern, professional, and AI-inspired aesthetic that meets performance and accessibility standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Color scheme defined and documented with AI-inspired palette
- [x] Typography system established using Inter font family
- [x] Component library structure planned and documented
- [x] Responsive design breakpoints defined for mobile-first approach
- [x] Animation plan created with performance considerations
- [x] Accessibility guidelines documented and implemented
- [x] Performance optimization strategy outlined and implemented
- [x] Design system documentation created
- [x] Component variants and states defined
- [x] Interactive elements designed with proper feedback

## Notes
- Color scheme is implemented with a blue gradient for primary colors and purple accents
- Typography uses Inter font family with a complete scale from xs to 6xl
- Component library is set up with shadcn/ui integration
- Accessibility features include proper focus states, contrast ratios, and semantic HTML
- Performance optimizations include CSS variable usage and efficient class merging
- Design system is documented in [/project/styles/design-system.md](cci:7://file:///Users/david/Projects/AI/excelsior/project/styles/design-system.md:0:0-0:0)
- Component variants and states are defined in the shadcn/ui configuration
- Animation system implemented with:
  - Fade-in animations for hero section
  - Scroll-triggered animations for content sections
  - Hover animations for interactive elements
  - Performance optimizations using Intersection Observer API
  - CSS transforms and opacity for smooth animations

## Implementation Steps
1. Define color palette:
   - Primary colors for AI theme
   - Secondary colors for accents
   - Neutral colors for backgrounds
   - Error/success states

2. Establish typography system:

3. Create animation plan:
   - Hero section animations:
     - Fade-in for main heading and subheading
     - Slide-up for call-to-action buttons
   - Features section animations:
     - Staggered fade-in for feature cards
     - Scale-up effect on hover for feature icons
   - CTA section animations:
     - Subtle background gradient animation
     - Button hover animations with scale and color transition
   - Performance considerations:
     - Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
     - Implement requestAnimationFrame for complex animations
     - Use will-change property for animated elements
     - Avoid animating layout properties
     - Implement debouncing for scroll-based animations

4. Establish typography system:
   - Heading hierarchy
   - Body text sizes
   - Line heights and spacing
   - Font weights

3. Create component library structure:
   - Base components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
   - Layout components (Navbar, Footer, Grid)
   - Interactive components (CTA, Form, Modal)
   - Utility components (Spinner, Toast)

4. Plan responsive design:
   - Mobile-first breakpoints
   - Component adjustments for different screen sizes
   - Content prioritization
   - Navigation patterns

5. Design animations:
   - Page transitions
   - Component interactions
   - Loading states
   - Error feedback

6. Implement accessibility:
   - ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Color contrast
   - Focus states

7. Optimize performance:
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Critical CSS
   - Font optimization

## Notes/Decisions/Challenges
- Focus on performance while maintaining visual appeal
- Ensure mobile-first approach
- Balance modern design with accessibility
- Consider future scalability of design system
- Plan for potential micro-interactions
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Ensure consistent design language across components
- Consider internationalization requirements
- Plan for dark/light mode support
